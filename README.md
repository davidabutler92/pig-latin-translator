# pig-latin

## Goal 

#### The gaol is to creat a webpage that takes the users input phrase and translate it to pig latin
#### By _**{David Butler}**_

## Description
#### First, here are the rules of Pig Latin:

* For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end.

* For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".

* If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!

* For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant.
